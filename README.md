# MD-HIT, Redundancy control for materials informatics
MD-HIT algorithms for reducing redundancy of materials composition or structure datasets (similar to CD-HIT in bioinformatics)

It can potentially improve the model performance on minority/OOD materials and provide more objective performance estimation.

Developed by Dr. Jianjun Hu, Nihang Fu of University of South Carolina and Qin Li from Guizhou University of Finance and Economics
